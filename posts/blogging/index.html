The thought of faffing with Wordpress and paying hosting charges was just one reason putting me off. And then once I&rsquo;d discovered Jekyll and Hugo [opportunity to create pages simply] and the possibility of github hosting the excuses not to make a start began to fall away.</p><p>More positively - since being retired I seem to have been involved in many projects which might benefit being &lsquo;written up&rsquo;. Not least that the process of writing up helps clarify the train of thought - and so can lead to insights guiding further progress.</p><p><strong>Technology:</strong> Given that I already use github as a convenient central storage for various code projects, the opportunity to use it for webhosting also seemed too good to pass by. Github further provides a basic level of support for static web site hosting - for example giving access to Jekyll and Hugo site &lsquo;compilation&rsquo; tools that can be configured to run following each new push.</p><p>Hugo is a compilation tool that essentially compiles a structured set of markdown files into a website. Templates and connfig files direct the output into a fairly professional looking sites. Hugo is written in Go. I have no interest in Go, however I do enjoy the simplicity of structured text creation that markdown enables.</p><p>So usng github and Hugo I have created this blog. As to why I chose Hugo over Jekyll and other alternatives - I just fancied trying Hugo. It&rsquo;s fast, reasonbly well documented and so far it just works - for me.</p><p>Visit the <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a> website!</p><p><img src=blog2.jpg alt="blog image local to this folder"></p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://drtim101.github.io/>&copy; Dr Tim101 2023</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
