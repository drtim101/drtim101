I have been meaning to create and write a blog for several years. The thought of faffing with Wordpress and paying hosting charges was just one reason putting me off. And then once I'd discovered Jekyll and Hugo [opportunity to create pages simply] and the possibility of github hosting the excuses not to make a start began to fall away.
  
More positively - since being retired I seem to have been involved in many projects which might benefit being 'written up'. Not least that the process of writing up helps clarify one's train of thought - and in so doing lead to further insights that might smooth the progress ahead.

**Technology:** Given that I already use github as a convenient central storage for various code projects, the opportunity to use it for webhosting also seemed too good to pass by. Github further provides a basic level of support for static web site hosting - for example giving access to Jekyll and Hugo site 'compilation' tools that can be configured to run following each new push.
  
Hugo is a compilation tool that essentially compiles a structured set of markdown files into a website. Templates and connfig files direct the output into a fairly professional looking sites. Hugo is written in Go. I have no interest in Go, however I do enjoy the simplicity of structured text creation that markdown enables.
  
So usng github and Hugo I created a blog. As to why I chose Hugo over Jekyll and other alternatives - I just fancied trying Hugo. It's fast, reasonbly well documented and so far it just works for me.
